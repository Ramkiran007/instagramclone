This is the instagram clone where user can signup and after signup you will receive the messege that you successfully signedup.
I used nodemailer sendgrid for this. After when user signin the account the token will be sent from the server side to make sure user is valid.
You can create post by uploading the images and your images will be appear in the home page. You can also search for pics in a "search for pics bar"
where you get images by just typing their names but you have to save the images. Also you can reset the password , you user will recieve an email for reset link and by clicking the link you
can reset your password. User can also see their own profile and posts which they have uploaded , just like an instagram profile.
This is just an basic website not that dynamic and intermediate. It is an beginner project.
